üõ†Ô∏è Available Macros
1. Clear Cell Contents
This macro allows you to quickly clear the contents of a specific cell, without deleting its formatting. Perfect for resetting data!

2. Hide Sheets
This script hides all sheets in your workbook except the active sheet. Great for protecting other sheets or focusing only on the current one.

3. Set Header When Printing
Automatically sets the title of each sheet in the header when printing. The title is taken from cell A2 on each sheet, making it ideal for adding consistent headers to reports.

4. Sum Cells by Color
This function calculates the sum of all cells that have the same background color. You specify a reference cell with the desired color, and it sums all matching cells in a given range.

5. Unhide Sheets
This macro makes all hidden sheets visible again, allowing you to quickly restore access to sheets you might have previously hidden.

6. Create Table of Contents
This macro generates a table of contents for your workbook, with hyperlinks to each sheet. The table is dynamically populated and can be placed anywhere in the workbook.
